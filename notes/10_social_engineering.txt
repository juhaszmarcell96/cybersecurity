Social Engineering
------------------

=> hacking the human
=> goal: convince a person to provide you with sensitive information or to execute some
         actions on your behalf
=> usually against employees of the target company
=> relies on impersonation = pretending to be someone else, someone with authority or someone
   who is trusted
=> not just virtually, you can got there and try to enter a building physically

   "there is no telling how far you can get inside of a building while carrying a ladder"

=> appear likable and familiar, ask nicely, ask for help
=> there is almost no risk to it, at most people will not help you, but it won't be flagged as
   a security incident

- social proof
    - in absence in any further instructions, most people behave as they see people behaving
      around them
    - if people don't know where to go, they will go where other people go
    - "you are the last person who hasn't clicked on this link"

- authority
    - people respect authority
    - if you can impersonate someone who has authority over your victim, it will be much
      easier to get information out of them

- artificial scarcity / false urgency
    - manifested in TV sale show, creates the false impression that if you don't take action
      right now, then you are missing out
    - appeal to people's sentiment of guilt, everyone has already done it, we need you to do
      this as well, otherwise you will be the person responsible for not installing this

- physical social engineering
    - dumpster diving: looking through the garbage generated by a company, it might include a
                       lot of confidential data
    - tailgating: watching for someone opening a secure door and follow them before it closes
    - piggybacking: ask someone to hold the door, your hands are full, just trying to make a
                    delivery

- other identity-based social engineering techniques
    - methods
        - compromised credentials: become a valid employee by stealing credentials
            - guessing username or password
            - use data from known data breaches
            - haveibeenpwned.com
        - shoulder surfing: watch what they are entering on the keyboard
        - lunchtime attacks:
            - often the security of a workstation is dependent on the physical security of
              that workstation
            - employees forget to lock their screens
    - objectives
        - performing identity fraud
        - stealing credentials to access the resources that those users have access to
        - fake invoicing automatically accepted by the financial department

- phishing
    - social engineering over email
    - tricking someone into accessing malicious content
    - spear phishing: not a mass spam campaign, but a targeted, directed campaign to a company
                      or department of a company (or even to a single person)
    - whaling: hunting high-level executives, like CEOs -> gold mine, have access to
               everything
- vishing: over a voice connection, over phone
- SMiShing: over SMS





- Spam & email social engineering
    - spam
    - hoaxes: scaring people with cyber threats to download some protection (malware)
    - email prepending: easy method to make an email trustworthy
        - when an attachment passes through a security system, it might prepend a header
          stating that the attachment was analyzed and it is safe to use, with some green
          background
        - you can craft this header yourself to make it look like it passed some security
          analysis
        - you can make it look like an email chain already having a some answers

- pharming
    - relies on a technical type of attack that makes a computer resolve a domain name to a
      fake IP address -> corrupting the DNS cache, hacking the DNS server
    - it is resolved to the attacker's website, which looks the same -> enters the credentials
- typosquatting
    - gathering valid user accounts simply by registering domain names that closely resemble
      well-known services or companies
    - doubling a letter, intentional typo
    - people sometimes mistype these websites (e.g. metflix.com)
- watering hole
    - wild animals periodically gather around water holes to drink
    - can happen inside of a company, e.g. everybody from the company frequently orders pizza
      from a close pizzeria through their website
      -> hack the pizza place's website, injecting a malware in there

- influence campaign
    - influence public opinion on political matters, or anything that the public opinion
      should not be influenced on
    - often networks of bots using fake accounts, promoting fake news, fake websites
    - trying to change the public opinions
