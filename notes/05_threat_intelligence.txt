Threat Intelligence
-------------------

-> how much do you know about possible attacks and attack sources?

- where do you get this information from?
- how do you keep devices up-to-date?

- researching TTPs of attacks
    - TTP = Tactic, Technique & Procedure
    - companies and universities -> published papers of researches
    - dark net and dark web
        - dark net:
            - overlay network that exists on top of the internet and requires specific
              configurations, software or authorization to access
            - is accessible using the TOR browser (The Onion Router)
        - dark web:
            - the content on the dark net
            - part of the deep web, which includes all parts of the web that are not indexed
              by standard search engines like google, because they are behind logins or in
              private databases
            - you have to know what you are looking for to find it
            - new exploits are usually being sold here
            - focused on anonymity
    - behavioral research: storytelling, how others detected a certain exploit
    - reputation sources: list of malicious IPs, URLs, email addresses, ...
    - attack signatures: used by intrusion prevention systems, they analyze traffic and look
                         for patterns that match known signatures
    - CTI feeds: Cyber Threat Intelligence -> presenting e.g. attack signatures
    - SIEM solutions: Security Information Event Management
        - gather events and try to correlate them to find out whether they have malicious
          intent
        - e.g.:
            - 16:30 : login from Germany
            - 16:35 : login from USA
            - when seen on their own, these are both legitimate events, but when examined
              together, there is potentially a malicious action going on
    - vendor-proprietary threat feeds
    - vendor documentation
    - ISACs: Information Sharing and Analysis Centers
        - threat intelligence sources for specific industries
    - OSINT: Open Source Intelligence
        - free information
        - attack signatures
        - IP blacklists
        - spam and phishing
    - papers, RFCs, talks, blogs, social media

- IoC: Indicator of Compromise
    - proofs of compromise
    - e.g.
        - malicious URLs found in logs
        - new files on the filesystem
        - unauthorized executions
        - unauthorized running processes
        - RAT (Remote Access Trojan - maintains access over longer times)
        - file hash change detected by file integrity monitoring system
        - unexpected changes detected by registries
        - resource management (e.g.: sudden high CPU utilization)
        - new applications
        - network protocols (unexpected network traffic)
        - new devices (you should have centralized IP address management system)
        - exfiltration (data theft)
    - automated tools for IoC analysis
        - HIPS/HIDS: Host-based Intrusion Prevention/Detection System
        - correlation SIEM tools







- Threat Modelling
    - lot of information is known: attack signatures, reputation lists, IoCs, ...
    - how to store, share and use this information
    => language: STIX (Structures Threat Information Expression)
        - v1 : XML
        - v2 : JSON
        - made up of SDOs (STIX Domain Object) describing observed data, files, URLs,
          indicators, patterns, ...
    => protocol: TAXII (Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information)
        - protocol used to communicate this data from machine to machine
        - collections:
            - client sends a request to the server asking for this information, server replies
        - channels:
            - clients are subscribers, and the server pushes the information to the clients
              when the producer publishes such a data to the server

- other threat data feeds (threat intelligence sources)
    - AIS: Automated Indicator Sharing
        - offered by the Department of Homeland Security
    - Threat Maps: revealing the currently happening attacks in real time all over the world
    - file and signature databases
        - list of malicious files, hashes, URLs, ...
        - used by antivirus tools
    - vulnerability databases: known vulnerabilities
        - people usually don't update that often
        - attackers are looking for software with specific versions presenting known
          vulnerabilities

- moving forward, next-generation threat detection
    - artificial intelligence and machine learning
    - fast decisions are needed even without prior known signatures
    - filters a huge amount of data in a short time
    + prediction-based analysis
        - monitor dark net for new attacks
        - block them before they are used
