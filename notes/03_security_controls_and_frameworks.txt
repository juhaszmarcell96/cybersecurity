Security Controls and Frameworks
--------------------------------

- security controls: something that makes you more secure
    - guideline, policy
    - firewall
    - technical controls
    - administrative controls
=> security controls improve CIA (confidentiality, integrity and availability)

- categories (according to the way we choose to implement them)
    - technical (hardware, software, configuration)
    - operational (humans, training programme)
    - managerial (high-level policies, how do we decide which controls to use)

- types (according to goals)
    - preventative: stops an attack or reduces its probability
    - detective: inform about incidents, effects, ...
    - corrective: recover after an incident (backups)
    - deterrent: discourage potential attackers (cameras, signs, warnings, ...)
    - compensating: if we cannot do what we should be doing (e.g. because of financial
                    reasons), then at least we are doing this...
    - physical: door, fences, lighting, access control, ...

- frameworks: sort of a guideline, how secure are we, what should we be aiming for?
    - regulatory: you must comply to be able to participate in that kind of a business (e.g.
                  payment, banking, medical records, ...)
    - non-regulatory: what you should have but you can decide, only suggestions

- examples
    - NIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology
        - CSF: Cyber Security Framework (IT security)
        - RMF: Risk Management Framework
        - FIPS: Federal Information Processing Standards
    - ISO: International Organization for Standardization
        - ISO 27001: generic security standard -> lot of companies are trying to achieve this
        - ISO 27002: classification of security controls
        - ISO 27017 & 27018: aimed for cloud environments
        - ISO 27701: privacy, personal data
        - ISO 31000: risk management
    - CSA: Cloud Security Alliance
        - security guidance
        - enterprise reference architecture
        - cloud control matrix
            - lists recommended security products
    - SSAE: Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagement
        - SOC2 and SOC3: Security Organization Control
            - audit specifications
            - "checklist"

- cybersecurity benchmarks
    => where are you lacking?
    - CIS: Center for Internet Security
        - gives a lot of benchmarks
        - scans installations, checks configurations
    - vendor documentation
        - security guidelines
        - vendor-specific
    - Department of Defense Cyber Exchange
        - some guidelines to help choosing the necessary software and hardware configurations
        - not vendor-specific
    - National Checklist Program
        - benchmark by NIST                                  ^  benchmarks are checking
        - helps to define necessary steps                    |  infrastructure on which
    ---------------------------------------------------------+  applications are running
    - infrastructure: devices, cloud
        - this is not your direct infrastructure, but keep in mind that you also have a cloud
          part of your infrastructure
    - applications: web, mobile, microservices, ...
        - checks the application code itself



- standards and regulations
    => you must abide by these regulations if you plan on doing business in a specific
       territory, with a specific type of data, or interacting with a specific entity (e.g.
       the government)
    - GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation
        - focused on privacy and protecting personally identifiable information
    - GLBA: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
        - for financial institutions
    - SOX: Sarbanes-Oxley Act
        - major companies abide by this to properly implement security controls, risk
          assessment, etc
    - CSA: Computer Security Act
        - for federal institutions
    - FISMA: Federal Information Security Management Act
    - HIPAA: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        - regarding medical records
    - CCPA
        - relevant in California
    - PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards
        - credit card transaction, processing payments
