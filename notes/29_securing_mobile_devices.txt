Securing Mobile Devices
-----------------------

- they are pretty powerful, and companies have very little inherent power over them

- how do we bring mobile devices inside the company?
    - BYOD : Bring Your Own Device (Disaster)
        - users are allowed to use their own device for business related tasks
        - companies need oversight over the devices -> users need to accept policies
        - users need to accept that monitoring apps will be installed on their devices
    - COBO : Corporate Owned, Business Only
        - you get a company phone and you can only use it for work tasks
        - hardened and locked device by the IT department
        - may be used for personal purposes (not always)
    - COPE : Corporate Owned, Personally-Enabled
        - still a company-owned device, but users are allowed to use it for personal tasks
        - the device is still subjected to the company's policies
    - CYOD : Choose Your Own Device
        - employees are given a list from which they can choose their device
        - the device is still owned by the company, and is hardened by IT
    - VDI : Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
        - not exactly mobile but can be
        - employees are provided with virtual machines running in data centers
        - users connect to these devices remotely
            - they still need some device to connect to the infrastructure
            -> thin clients : very simple devices with a network interface and some USBs, and
               can only do one thing, connect to the remote workstation
                - from a management and security perspective, this is heaven
                - patches are easy to install on the virtual machines
                - from a user perspective, it is not that great, highly controlled work
                  environment, large delay
                - data center and internet connections are additional points of failures
            -> thick client
