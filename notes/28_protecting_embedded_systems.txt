Protecting Embedded Systems, ICS & SCADA
----------------------------------------

- embedded system -> performs one single, simple task
- industrial systems are similar in this manner, they are also designed to do one task
- they are considered to be static -> limited configuration or update possibilities
    - weak and cheap hardware
    - if there are vulnerabilities discovered, they cannot be patched (not always)
    - resource constrained memory, CPU and battery -> not antivirus or firewall
    - weak crypto, vulnerable to tampering
        - perimeter protection: protect the network, not the device
    - no TPM chip

- firmware
    - code that runs on an embedded system
    - often runs on PLCs (programmable logic controllers)
    - SoC (system on a chip), one-board computers
        - mini-computers
        - like Raspberry-Pi or Arduino
        - not static like embedded devices and are quite powerful
    - ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit)
        - simple hardware controllers
        - limited set of instructions
        - immutable
        - e.g. routers, security devices (for encryption and decryption)
        - really fast
        - code is written in the factory
    - FPGA (field programmable gate arrays)
        - FPGAs can be reprogrammed
        - like a reprogrammable ASIC

- RTOS (real-time operating system)
    - where you need extreme predictability
    - used in automation and time-sensitive operations
    - no delay, no interruption to perform something else
        - not even for security functions
    - easy to DoS attacks -> or just mess up the timing
    - monitor and harden their attack surface -> perimeter security

- embedded systems communication
    - they still have to talk to each other
    - OT (operational technology) networks
        - any network in an industrial environment
        - e.g. industrial ethernet
    - cellular -> more convenient
        - relies on SIM identity
        - NB-IoT is a low power LTE (4G), less than 100Kbps, good range
            - narrow band IoT
            - does not eat up that much battery
        - LTE-M, up to 1Mbps
        - both compatible with 5G
        - operator encrypts between device and antenna tower
        - internal network can be IPSec
    - Z-Wave
        - IoT devices, smart homes
        - 900MHz
        - supports mesh repeaters
        - built-in encryption
        - vulnerable to deauthentication attack
    - Zigbee
        - IoT devices, smart homes
        - 2.4GHz
        - good range, wide variety of devices, lot of vendors
        - built-in encryption
        - vulnerable to deauthentication attack

- Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
    - to control industrial machinery
    - designed with functionality in mind
    - focused on efficiency and safety
    - security is just an afterthought
    - interaction, monitoring from a HMI (human-machine interface), can be regular software
    -> SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition)
        - many ICSs spread all over the place, controlled from a centralized location
        - energy, utilities, transportation, manufacturing, ...
        - can run on general-purpose computers as software
        - no built-in or weak security
        - Stuxnet: an attack designed against SCADA

- IoT (internet of things)
    - devices with sensors and software to send data
    - hub system for communication and control
        - e.g. use zigbee to reach the central hub in your home network
    - smart "things"
    - e.g. home automation, smart meters
    - Internet of Threats -> very little focus on security
        - user-friendly
        - easy to set up
        - the public does not care about security
        - painfully insecure
        - no upgrade capability
        - badly documented, you don't even know what it does

- BAS (building automation systems)
    - like a home automation system but for large buildings
    - smart HVAC, power, elevators, lighting
    - vulnerable systems, usually overlooked in assessments
    - faulty assumption is that these are isolated systems that do no need protection
    - often hard-coded credentials or still using the default passwords

- MFPs (multifunctional printers)
    - low security computers
    - everybody is updating their laptops, servers, etc, but nobody cares about the printers
        - full of vulnerabilities
        - lives in the middle of your enterprise network

- vehicles and drones
    - for entertainment
    - computer-assisted driving
    - ECUs (electronic control units) connected to a CAN (controller area network) bus
    - external interface: OBD (onboard diagnostics)
    - CAN bus has no security
        - every message is a broadcast
        - no security, no encryption, no authentication

- medical devices
    - legacy protocols and OSes
    - not just in hospitals, but wearable devices as well
    - high impact of compromise

- securing embedded systems
    - network segmentation -> separate these devices
        - protect that network segment even more
    - add security "on top"
        - e.g. run IPSec tunnels
    - difficult or no updates
        - if updates can be installed, do so
        - even if the firmware can only be updated manually, do it
        - if no updates, replace them
    - air gapping
        - isolate these devices, no physical and logical connection
        - hard to administer -> you need to physically connect to that network first
            - or use a data diode -> communication flows only in one way
                - e.g. only outgoing traffic is allowed to report sensor data
                - could also be done using firewalls, but firewalls can be hacked
                - these diodes are physically wired so that it is physically impossible for
                  data to run in the other direction
                - the diode takes care of the protocols that need bidirectional communication
                  (e.g. TCP handshake)
