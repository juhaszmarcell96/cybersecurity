Attack and Attacker
-------------------

- risk = vulnerability + threat
    - vulnerability: weakness, hardware and software bug, misconfiguration, no input
                     validation
    - risk: potential of exploitation
    - can be high vulnerability and low threat, vice versa, any combination

- categories
    - internal: has access, mode dangerous, can be an employee
    - external: from outside of company, no privileges, has to penetrate
    - intent: what is the end goal? e.g. data
    - motivation: what is the reason? e.g. curiosity, greed
    - capabilities: available tools, time, money

- attacker types
    - hacker: uses a system in a different way than it was designed for
    - script kiddie: uses hacking tools without knowing what it does
    - hacktivist: political reasons, ideologies
    - APT: Advanced Persistent Threats
        - APT groups: advanced, dedicated groups
        - attack maintaining access over time, hidden for a long time
    - criminal syndicate: related to APT groups, sponsored by governments
    - competitor: another company, usually relying on internal threats

- insider threats
    - intentional or unintentional
    - already has access and some permissions
    - rogue employees
    - difficult to detect, they may be able to cover their tracks, tamper with the logs
    - users are usually not security-aware
    - installing unauthorized third-party software of hardware
    - using public file-sharing for company data

- attack surface
    - exposure
    - amount of points of entry
    - smaller for outsider threats
    - social engineering
    - physical security

- attack vectors
    - one point of entry
    - e.g.:
        - email (phishing)
        - social engineering
        - removable media (USB stick, parking lot attack -> just leave it there and hope that
          someone finds it and uses it)
        - wireless (can be intercepted even outside of the building)
        - websites (social media)
        - local workstation access (lock your screen)
        - cloud (usually protected with a single username and password)
        - supply chain (instead of attacking the network directly, attack one of the
          manufacturers of the devices and install malware during the manufacturing process)
