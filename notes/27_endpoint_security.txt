Endpoint Security
-----------------

- securing the network is the first step -> securing the hosts connected to the network is the
  next step

- hardware Root of Trust (RoT)
    - root of trust or trust anchor
        - this is a secure subsystem, built into the hardware of a laptop, desktop, server...
        - provides attestation = a statement or declaration
            - states that the state of the hardware is secure
            - when a host connects to the network, it is supposed to send some kind of a
              report or attestation, stating that it has scanned the operating system files
              and has not found any malware or tempered files
            - this report is supposed to be digitally signed
            - the server that decides whether this new device can access the network needs to
              validate this signature and check report
    - even large companies don't develop their own laptops
    - how do you know that your laptops have no built-in back doors?
    - this RoT is built into the TPM chip (Trusted Platform Module)
        - cryptographic processor and storage
            - stores keys, passwords, identities
        - TPM is not necessarily a chip, it could also be a piece of software, e.g. emulated
          for a virtual machine
        - TPM is rather an implementation, but is more often than not implemented in hardware
        - tamper-proof, crypto-shredding
            - cannot be hacked
            - or if hacked, it cannot be consistently altered
            - crypto-shredding = when someone tries to temper with the chip, the contents are
              destroyed
        - level of security is high enough for enterprise security
        - TPM is a black box, it has a predefined key built into it, called an endorsement key
            - exposes cryptographic operations to you, like key generation based on the key
            - that endorsement key cannot be changed

- securing boot
    - one of the first things that boots is the operating system
    - if the OS is compromised, it does not matter what security measures are installed onto
      the OS
    - there is no BIOS anymore, what launches the OS is nowadays the UEFI
        - Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
        - has pretty mich the same features as a BIOS
        - has a lot more security features, e.g. secure boot
    - secure boot
        - certificates from known vendors stored in UEFI
            - it does not run any malware scanner
            - rather it relies on integrity checks, hashing and certificates
            - stores certificates from known OS vendors
            - it checks against these certificates when the OS is booting
        - prevents booting from a malicious OS
        - secure boot does not require a TPM
    - measured boot
        - checks hashes of OS files
        - does not prevent booting malicious OS files
        - warns and alerts when unsigned code is detected
        - it uses the TPM for the hash checks
    - boot attestation
        - generate a summary report of the host's boot status and send it to a network access
          server, to a centralized point of access granting decision making
        - access granted or denied based on the report's contents
        - the report is digitally signed by a key stored in the TPM
        - what happens if the attestation fails? -> up to the security policy
            - fully deny access
            - grant limited access
    - full disk encryption
        - encrypts entire disk
        - filesystem ACLs are only relevant for the host's OS
        - the operating system protect's other user's files as long as the disk is connected
          to that operating system that was used to create those files
        - if the disk is connected to a different machine, you have access to the whole disk
        - unless of course the disk is fully encrypted -> confidentiality without relying on
          the operating system
        - relies on a key that is stored in the TPM chip (does not make sense to store the key
          on the disk)
        - TPM usually offers a separate partition for the OS to store their own cryptographic
          information, like BitLocker has access to this partition
        - the key can also be stored on a removable storage, like a USB stick
            - great if you want to move the disk to a new device
            - if the key is stored on the TPM, the disk cannot be moved to a new device
        - encrypting and decrypting stuff is computationally intensive
            - CPU and memory overhead
            - Self Encrypting Drives (SEDs) -> offloading crypto operations to the HDD/SSD
                - small crypto processor added to the SSD, which does these computations
                - keys:
                    - MEK (Media Encryption Key)
                        - also called DEK (Data Encryption Key)
                        - this key is encrypted by an asymmetric key pair called KEK
                    - KEK (Key Encryption Key)
                        - not the user's password
                        - it is derived from the user's password
                        - password is run through a process of key stretching
                        - more secure key
                - at some point you might want to change your password but don't want to
                  decrypt everything and then encrypt it again
                    - this way only KEK needs to be updated and the MEK re-encrypted

- other endpoint risks
    - USB and Flash Drive risks
        - USB device firmware can be compromised: malicious code, pretending to be another
          device, e.g. a USB stick can act like a keyboard
        - a USB stick can be made to input shell commands with superhuman speed
        - a USB stick can also present itself as a USB network card
            - it can override your DNS entries and redirect you to other websites
        - don't plug in any found USB devices
        - sanitize USB devices using "sheep dip" systems
            - test them in an isolated environment ("sandboxed environments")
        - autorun risks are also present with malicious USB sticks
        - peripheral access can also be controlled
            - using group policy on windows
            - can be configured by the company, but is really annoying for users if they
              cannot plug in anything
    - supply chain risks: trust or verify
        - if any component, like the CPU or the TPM have been tempered with, then the whole
          system is compromised
        - manufacturing, assembly, shipping, IT department
        - how do you trust the supply chain?
            - most companies just buy stuff from reputable vendors and that's it
            - large companies or government entities cannot rely on reputation only
                - they might be able to conduct their own security assessments into the supply
                  chain of the company that delivers their hardware
    - end-of-life
        - end-of-sale: the product is no longer sold, this is not that dangerous
        - end-of-support: this is the dangerous one, no more security updates or patches
            - comes later after the end-of-sale, maybe even 10 years after
        - abandonware: no more vendor support
            - smaller vendors, smaller projects, open-source projects
            - no strong release cycle
            - no specified end-of-support deadline
            - suddenly no more support
            - long-term-support
                - for large open-source project, updates are as guaranteed as it can be for a
                  specified number of years

- endpoint hardening
    - complex process, starts with evaluating the security posture, then make it more secure
    - the endpoint is one of the most complicated device in the network
        - versatile, does multiple things
        - can run several different applications, ...
    - applications
        - vulnerable, expose attack matrices
        - should be the first thing to secure
        - number of allowed applications should be limited to the necessary ones
        - no third-party software, no randomly downloaded software
    - services
        - similar to apps, but are not so visible
        - there are default services, many of them are useless for yor purposes
        - many services are waiting for incoming network traffic
    - network interfaces
        - this is where attacks are coming from
        - isolated device is impenetrable, but useless at the same time
        - disable additional network interface with no benefit to you
        - for servers and switches, separate the management interfaces from the rest of the
          network
    - devices
        - secure the external devices that are connecting to your workstations
        - control what peripherals are allowed
    - storage
        - even if the entire device is stolen, data should still be protected
        - use disk encryption

- endpoint baseline
    - how does a good workstation look like -> baseline
        - baseline for desktop PC
        - baseline for server
        - baseline for mobile device
        - ...
    - baseline contains all of the necessary security features that need to be enabled on that
      device every time it boots
        - as for windows PCs, all the settings are stored in the registry -> can be checked
        - if they connect in an active directory setting, hosts receive GPOs (Group Policy
          Objects) -> deviations from these objects need to be investigated

- patch management
    - no software is without vulnerabilities
    - devices should be up-to-date, especially security updates should be installed
    - patch management process is very important
    - there are dedicated solutions out there called vulnerability scanners that can detect
      known vulnerabilities based on known signatures
        - they cannot detect unknown vulnerabilities
        - a vulnerability scanner in itself is not a security solution, it just reports the
          known vulnerabilities, which then should be patched
    - there are automatic and manual tools as well
    - an update might break what was previously working
        - patch management should be preceded by a phase where the patch is tested in an
          isolated environment
    - issues with legacy, EOL systems
        - smart IoT devices sometimes have no update possibility

- endpoint security solutions
    - they are good, but people hate them
    - categories
        - malware protection (+ sandboxing)
            - antivirus
            - based on a database of signatures
            - can be cloud-based, calculates hashes for files locally, and searches for the
              hash in the cloud, checking against the valid hashes
        - intrusion protection
            - HIDS (host-based intrusion detection system), HIPS (prevention)
            - more complex
        - EPP (endpoint protection platforms)
            - the ones that annoy the users
            - malware scanning
            - check your searches and URLs
            - does spam filtering
            - act as firewalls
            -> can be slow
        - DLP (data loss prevention)
            - monitors data that you are trying to exfiltrate
            - check what you are attaching to emails
            - checks HTTP, FTP, ...
            - issues with encrypted tunnels and password-protected files
        - EDR (endpoint detection and response)
            - detect intrusion attempts
            - have visibility over how that intrusion developed over time, maybe even over
              multiple workstations
                - what files were downloaded
                - how that file was executed, how it propagated over the network
                - what did the malware do on each host
            - it is able to detect unknown malware without signatures
                - can stop the malware, prevent it from being executed on the hosts
