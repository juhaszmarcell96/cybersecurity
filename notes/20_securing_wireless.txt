Securing Wireless
-----------------

- on one hand, securing wireless networks sounds simple
    - same protocols
    - same MAC addresses
    - same routing based on IP addresses
    - same applications as on wired networks
- on the other hand, it is not simple
    - everyone can intercept the traffic
    - attackers don't have to get inside the building, server room, ...
    - attackers only need to be physically close

- wireless network design
    - where are the access points
    - how are the antennas oriented
    - what coverage do the APs offer, do we want close to zero signal leakage outside of the
      business area
    - the further you are, the weaker the signal, lower the speed, higher the error rate
    - what are the walls made of, can they be penetrated by signals
    - interference -> many devices use the same wireless frequencies

- access point (AP)
    - device that you are connecting to wirelessly in order to gain access to the network
    - wireless switch
    - BSSID (basic service set identifier) : access point's MAC address
    - SSID : network's "name"

- wireless communication is just a bunch of standards specifying
    - what frequencies you are allowed to use
    - how are the frames transmitted
    - what security you can and should use

=> protocols are mainly differentiated based on the frequency
    - 802.11b/g/n/ax -> 2.4GHz
    - 802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax -> 5GHz

- the frequency bands are split into channels
    - goal is to allow parallel connections for higher data rates
    - size of these channels depend on the standard
    - there are multiple overlapping channels, e.g. 14 channels for the 2.4GHz range
    - however, these are overlapping channels, only a couple non-overlapping channels can be
      used at the same time
        - e.g. one device can use channels 1, 6 and 11 without overlap
        - co-channel interference is when two devices try to communicate over the same channel
            - of course layer 1 and 2 protocols prevent devices communicating over the same
              channel
        - adjacent channel interference: if another device uses an adjacent channel, like
          channel 2, there will be some interference
            - fewer errors, but still a noticeable signal degradation
    - if you properly design your wireless network, such interferences can be avoided
        - site survey: maps the entire layout of the building, takes the walls and even the
          materials into account
            - a person walks in the building and measures the signal strength
            - if it is not sufficient, access points might be placed elsewhere, antennas might
              get re-oriented, ...
            - produces a heat-map: colorful representation of the signal strength

- wireless LAN controller (WLC)
    - centralized management for wireless access points
    - 1 or 2 APs are easy to manage individually, but managing 100+ APs is hard and poses
      security risks
    - it is a software app that controls and configures the access points
    - it pushes the configurations to all of the APs
    - also, all of the traffic coming through the APs is routed through the WLC
    => it is a centralized point of traffic and configuration
    - it is a wired device, it is connected to the wired network and also the wireless APs are
      connected to it with wires, it is called wireless because it controls the wireless APs
    - WLC security is very important, even more important than that of APs

- security protocols
    - man-in-the-middle in wireless is almost no man-in-the-middle at all, because everyone
      can listen to the traffic
    => WEP & WPA
    - goal: encryption, authentication, key handling, key rotation, ...
    - some of the standards have been deprecated
        - because of detected flaws
        - because the current computational capacity of devices makes it possible to crack
          these algorithms
    - upgrading the whole wireless infrastructure is not an easy task, because often these
      protocols are hardcoded into hardware chips of devices
        => this is one of the major problems with wireless security nowadays, that people are
           still using these old devices which have known vulnerabilities
    - WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)
        - one of the first wireless security protocol ever invented
        - highly unsecure, very weak
        - don't ever use it, on newer devices WEP is not even an option
    - WPA (WiFi Protected Access)
        - v1 : RC4, TKIP
            - RC4 is an encryption algorithm, also used by WEP, but WPA fixed a few flaws in
              the original WEP by maintaining the same encryption algorithm -> easier to
              upgrade older devices
            - TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol) was designed to provide more secure
              encryption than the earlier WEP, without needing to replace existing hardware
            => not secure enough
        - v2 : AES (128-bit), CCMP
            - AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is still in use
            - CCMP (Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)
                - was designed to defeat replay attacks (replay authentication packets)
                - by embedding secret information in the packets (packet number and key ID)
            => even WPAv2 is vulnerable
        - v3 : AES GCMP, SAE, Enhanced Open, MPF
            - AES GCMP
                - upgraded encryption protocol
                - increased key length, up to 192 bits
            - SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)
                - another type of handshake, the initial exchange of packets
                - v2 handshake had some vulnerabilities
                - this is an implementation of the Diffie-Hellman protocol
            - Enhanced Open
                - a way to ensure encryption even for clients that use open authentication
                - before this, if a network was open, meaning no password or any other
                  credentials were required, there was basically no guarantee for any security
                  measures, no encryption
            - MPF (Management Protection Frames)
                - management frames are special types of frames that were often targeted by
                  attackers
                    - they are used to announce specific events in a wireless network
                    - they were unprotected, unauthenticated (clear text)
                    - e.g. deauthentication attacks: craft management frames and send them to
                      access points that you might even not be connected to, to cause
                      everybody getting deauthenticated, because the access point has no way
                      of checking that these frames are coming from an actual client
                - these are not protected

- "personal" WiFi Authentication
    - for non-enterprise networks
    - password of "preshared key" (PSK)
        - also known as group authentication
        - key has to be shared with everyone who is supposed to connect to the network as well
          as with the access point
        - no identity information tied to the password, because everybody uses the same one
        - right now, keys have to be at least 8 and at most 63 characters
        - the encryption key is not the one that you have provided as the pre-shared key
            - your key (password) is put through a process of hashes -> HMAC of 256 bits
            - Hash-based Message Authentication Code
            - that is used as the encryption key
            - this is called key stretching -> you take a smaller key and make a longer key
              from it using a series of computations
    => WPA3 personal authentication
        - no centralized server for authentication
        - used in smaller offices or at home
        - PAKE (Password Authenticated Key Exchange)
            - the process of generating the keys
        - SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)
            - the handshake protocol
            - WPA2 4-way handshake was vulnerable
        - Dragonfly: Diffie-Hellman with elliptic curve cryptography
            - the actual name of the handshake protocol, SAE is a variant of the Dragonfly
              Key Exchange
    - WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)
        - another authentication method for wireless networks
        - configuring SSIDs, passwords, choosing encryption algorithms is pretty complicated
        - with a WPS device you can connect to a network by simply pushing a WPS button or by
          entering a PIN code, all the hassle of setting up an SSID and passphrase is taken
          care of for you automatically by the device itself
        - considered insecure, but is still available
        - if you have access to the router and are trying to connect, you push a button and
          are automatically connected
            - when the button is pushed, the key-based authentication shifts to a pin-based
              authentication
            - it is just an 8 character pin, usually written on the back of the device
            - this pin can easily be cracked by brute force
                - not because it is 8 digits, it is still a lot of combinations
                - but WPS is designed in a way that the client first sends the first 4 digits
                  of the 8-digit pin, and the AP replies whether those 4 digits are correct or
                  not -> only 10000 attempts
                - then the next 4 digits are sent, of which 3 digits are independent digits,
                  but the last one is a parity checking digit -> 1000 attempts
                => 11000 combinations (not 1 billion as the 8 digits would require)
        - WPS is hardware-dependent
            - vendors could at most disable it but not upgrade it
            - make sure that WPS is disabled
        - WPS was replaced by Easy Connect in WPA3
            - similar process to registering an IoT device (smart light bulb, ...)
                - scan a QR code, perform some wireless authentication
            - Easy Connect allows you to enroll a device simply by scanning a QR code or NFC

- Open Authentication
    - no authentication
    - any type of public WiFi, restaurants, hotels
    - can use Captive Portals: just a pop-up or webpage that shows up whenever you are
      connecting to that network, making you accept terms and conditions, or making you pay
      for the internet
    - in WPA2 traffic is also unencrypted
        - no confidentiality
        - not all traffic is unencrypted, like HTTPS or SSH are still encrypted
    - in WPA3, we have WiFi Enhanced Open using OWE (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption)
        - using dynamically generated keys
        - provides confidentiality but still no authentication, still anyone can connect

- 802.1X Authentication
    - enterprise WiFi Authentication
    - also knows as WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise
    - centralized point for managing the authentication
        - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting server
            - database holding the user identities and their credentials
        - Access Point contacts the AAA Server on behalf of the user that wants to connect,
          grab the user's credentials, send them to the AAA Server and wait for a response
        - Supplicant > Authenticator > AAA Server
            - Supplicant: client that wants to connect
            - Authenticator: the Access Point relaying the authentication information from the
              supplicant to the AAA server, and then back with the response
            - AAA Server: RADIUS or TACACS+
    - EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) over Wireless -> EAPoW
        - a suite of protocols
        - you can still use shared keys (though you probably don't want to)
        - you can use digital certificates, smart cards, biometrics, SIM cards, ...
            - EAP is the wrapper around all of these authentication protocols
        - EAPoW is the type of protocol that is allowed for unauthenticated users
            - to send authentication attempts
            - if a user is rejected by the AAA server, they remain restricted to EAPoW

- EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
    - different implementations for different authentication methods
    - umbrella for a multitude of protocols
    - EAP-TLS
        - Transport Layer Security
        - encrypted TLS tunnel between the supplicant and the authentication server
        - you first present a public key to be validated by the other party
            - both the supplicant and the authentication server do this art the same time
            - they are both being authenticated to one-another, they both need to recognize
              the other
        - both the client and the server need digital certificates installed in them
            - a bit difficult to implement in a large-scale network
    - PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)
        - again, encrypted TLS tunnel
        - simpler version of the EAP-TLS, easier to implement
        - only the server needs a digital certificate
        - client can use passwords (MS-CHAPv2) or tokens (EAP-GTC)
            - you need an inner authentication method inside the EAP, such as MS-CHAPv2
              (Microsoft version of the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
    - EAP-TTLS (EAP with Tunnelled TLS)
        - wasn't TLS already tunnelled? - yes it was, this is just abusing the language
        - similar to PEAP, only server-side certificate, the client can choose the method
            - PEAP only allows for MS-CHAPv2 or EAP-GTC
            - now the client can use whatever they want as long as it is supported by the EAP
              scheme (PAP, CHAP, whatever they want, very flexible)
    - EAP-FAST (EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunnelling)
        - similar to PEAP
        - does not use any certificates, but a secure password
            - PAC (Protected Access Credential), not exactly a pre-shared key, but rather a
              dynamically generated one using some sort of a Diffie-Hellman implementation
        - issue with distributing the PAC
        - issue with no server identity proof, anybody can act as a face access point

- rogue access points
    - any AP that you don't know about or haven't authorized
        - accidental or malicious
    - rogue AP announcing the same SSID as a legitimate one is an "Evil Twin"
        - man-in-the-middle attack
        - malicious DNS redirect
        - phishing attacks
        - tough to detect, most mobile phones don't even support the function of validating
          the AP's MAC address
        - discovery:
            - physical: look for them and find them
            - spectrum analyzer: scan for interferences

- WiFi attacks
    - deauthentication attacks
        - sending a special type of management frame for deauthenticating clients
        - to force a re-authentication for intercepting it
        - to force the client to stop talking to the access point
        - maybe only for a denial of service (DoS) attack
    - disassociation attacks
        - also with spooked management frames
        - disassociated host is not exactly disconnected, but cannot send traffic until it is
          associated again
        - DoS
    => management frames are protected in WPA3 using MFP
    - PSK attacks
        - aim to capture the pre-shared key
        - hash of the passphrase can be captured during authentication
        - then run the hash through a rainbow table or an offline cracking algorithm
        - also called IV (initialization vector) attacks in WEP using replay attack
            - they relied on a number on every packet called an initialization vector (IV)
            - IV generation was pretty faulty
                - you just needed to make the AP generate a lot of new IVs by sending spooked
                  traffic, and at some point the AP started to recycle the IVs, which revealed
                  which part of the bit stream is the IV and which part is the encrypted hash
        - KRACK for WPA
            - an attack for both WPA and WPA2
            - exploits the 4-way handshake
            - this is why WPA3 has a new handshake protocol
    - jamming attack
        - you just spam the wireless spectrum so that no one can communicate over the spectrum
        - DoS attack
        - can easily be detected
        - jamming wireless signals is often illegal
