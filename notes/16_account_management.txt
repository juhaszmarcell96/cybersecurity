Account Management
------------------

=> managing the digital identities of users
    - gathering information
    - store that information
    - privilege changes
    - leaving employees
    - ...

- role of HR
    - HR provides the necessary information for a digital identity of joining employees
    - HR does background checks and creates a profile even before the hiring process is over
    - during onboarding:
        - provide credentials (cards, keys, ...)
        - provide devices (phones, laptops, ...)
        - provide training (security training, ...)
    - during normal business operations
        - disseminate security policies
        - they make sure that employees are informed about changes in policies
    - during termination
        - disable credentials (usually not deleted, just disabled)
        - retrieve devices

- personnel security
    - involvement of the employees within the company's security policies
    - collaboration between HR and IT
    - goal: to avoid employees abusing their privileges to perform unauthorized actions or to
            gain some personal advantage
    - policies:
        - separation of duties
            - sharing responsibility among multiple people so that a single one cannot abuse
              the system
            - trying to avoid insider threats
            - SOP (standard operating procedure): a document that contains the job role of the
              employees
            - as long as no one derails from the SOP, everything should be fine
            - e.g. approval process - action approved by someone else
        - least privilege
            - applies not only to persons, but to services and software as well
            - you get the least possible privileges, only sufficient to do your job but no
              more than that
            - also to limit the access of potentially compromised accounts
            - should also be managed when employees switch roles, people should not retain the
              privileges of their old department
        - job rotation
            - one person should hold the same job for a limited amount of time
            - knowledge is then not constrained to a single person, but a team
            - lowers the chance of abuse of credentials, because there are other people
              knowing about what you do
        - mandatory vacation
            - another person takes your job for a limited amount of time so that you cannot
              hide malicious activity
            - also good for detecting that the hired person is not doing their job properly

- offboarding policies
    - when an employee leaves the company
    - manage accounts (including shared accounts)
        - disable accounts
        - change passwords for shared accounts (don't use shared accounts...)
    - user encrypted data
        - what do you do if you need to access that data as an employer some time in the
          future, maybe for an investigation about malicious activities
        - keep the private keys of that user in a database
    - physical assets
        - laptop, phone, keys, cards, ...
        - make sure that the user has no backup of that data
    => never a 0% risk when someone is leaving the company

- types of accounts
    - generic users
        - not able to change policies
        - least privilege
    - guest accounts
        - anonymous login
        - LEAST privilege, almost next to none (only maybe regulated internet access)
        - consider disabling (do you really need it?)
        - come with a lot of security risks
    - administrator accounts
        - first target of attacks
        - secure credentials, should be bulletproof
        - can alter security policies
        - if an attacker gets their hand on an admin account, they might be clever enough not
          to use it for attacks but for lowering security policies or creating users
    - shared accounts
        - these are the worst
        - login credentials are known by a number of people
        - no identity information
        - no non-repudiation (no unique identification)
        - no credential security
    - generic admin accounts
        - e.g. admin:admin default accounts pre-configured for devices
        - built into systems by default
        - lot of people don't change the passwords
        - often targeted by attackers

- group-based policies
    - assigning policies to groups instead of individual users
    - what servers, URLs, applications, file servers, ... can they access?
    -> assigning these on an individual user bases is not very efficient and is risky
    - users become members of security groups
        - developers
        - database admins
        - security testers
        - ...
    - users inherit the permissions of the groups they are members of
        - makes user and permission management easier
    - a user can be a member of multiple groups
    - default security groups
        - most operating systems has these
        - e.g. USERS on windows
        - e.g. on Linux, there are user groups that users can be members of, and a special
               group is the sudoers, who have super user access (/etc/sudoers)

- Windows and Linux service accounts
    - service accounts = "machine" accounts (on Windows)
        - services use these accounts, e.g. a server that wants to connect to a database
        - system: ultimate account on Windows
        - local service: similar to a regular user account, but is used by services
        - network service: can authenticate itself over the network, has network privileges
    - on Linux, this is simples
        - every user looks the same, service accounts are no different from normal user
          accounts either
        - only difference: service accounts usually don't allow an interactive shell
        - these accounts are created automatically when installing packages
            - e.g. an apache user gets created, but you cannot log in as that account

- Linux Secure Shell (SSH) Keys
    - used for remote CLI access, file transfer (scp) and tunneling
    - secure connection remotely, over a non-secure channel
    - SSH tunneling means transporting arbitrary data over an encrypted SSH connection
    - SSH relies on 2 key pairs
        - server has one (host key), presents the public key to the client
        - user first uploads their public key to the server's database
            - if later traffic comes in that is encrypted with a private key that corresponds
              to one of the public keys in the database, then that connection is going to be
              allowed

- Third-Party Credentials
    - used for managing applications through APIs
    - used with cloud provides as well
    - e.g. the key that you are generating into the cloud console that allows you to access
           cloud resources
    - those keys need to be kept secret

- account policies
    - what a user can and cannot do
    - digital identity: set of digital information that makes up a digital profile
        - full name
        - email address
        - department
        - unique ID
    - access policy: actual set of resources that the user has access to
        - individual or groups membership
        - on Windows, this is done through GPO (group policy object)
            - can be used to configure privileges for both users and groups in a Windows
              active directory system
    - password policies
        - length
        - complexity
        - change frequency
        - reuse?
    - location-based policies (physical) -> dangerous countries
    - location-based policies (network) -> untrusted networks, or an IP address can be
                                           correlated to a region as well
    - time-based policies -> when and how long can a user access some resources

- not an easy task...
    => too many privileges
    => too many restrictions
    - both are problematic
    - privilege review: auditing process for the security policies

- account usage audits
    - audit for user activity
    - recording key activity indicators
        - login
        - resource access
        - process creation
        - policy changes
        - settings changes
        - privilege escalation
    - log events => where did a breach come from, who attacked, who caused it, ...

- Disabling Accounts
    - account disabling: not working here anymore, malicious activity
    - account expiration: temporary accounts e.g. for external users from other companies
    - account lockout: e.g. automatic reaction when malicious activity is detected
