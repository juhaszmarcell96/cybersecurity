Securing Networks
-----------------

- common network design issues
    - prioritizing Availability over Confidentiality or Integrity
        - description: networks are often designed with a focus on ensuring continuous
          availability (business continuity)
        - problem: security, including integrity and confidentiality, is deprioritized
        - takeaway: while availability is critical, neglecting security can leave networks
          exposed to breaches
    - overreliance on perimeter security
        - description: traditional security focuses on the network's borders (firewalls, vpn
          entry points)
            - preventing people from getting in
            - this is a design flaw
        - problem: if attackers bypass perimeter defenses, they gain unrestricted access
          within the network
        - solution: modern smarter systems implement a zero-trust model
            - never assume devices or users inside the network are safe, they might be
              compromised
            - continuously verify all activities, even within the network
    - single points of failure (SPOF)
        - description: a single device (e.g. a router or firewall) controls access to critical
          resources
        - problem: if the device fails or is compromised, the network's availability or
          security collapses
            - you either loose access to the resource
            - or the device "fails open" -> everybody can get through
            - if it gets compromised, then nothing stops an attack
        - solution: redundancy and failover mechanisms prevent outages and security lapses
    - overly complex configurations
        - description: complex networks create challenges in
            - managing traffic flows
            - identifying and fixing issues
            - even admins might not understand it
        - impact on security: increased interdependencies and obscure configurations
            - introduces unforeseen vulnerabilities
                - even if you have no single point of failure, if the services are too much
                  dependent on each other, the failure of one can lead to inaccessibility
    - lack of documentation and change management
        - description: undocumented network changes or assets create
            - difficulty in audits
            - ongoing exposure to risks from forgotten or misconfigured devices
                - undocumented assets
                - undocumented services
                - these undocumented objects will not be included in security updates and
                  security assessments
        - solution: maintain up-to-date documentation and enforce change management protocols

- ISO/OSI basic network devices
    - layer 2 devices (switches, access points):
        - layer 2 (data link): manages communication within a single network (mac addresses)
        - forward frames based on mac addresses
        - extend broadcast domain
            - a broadcast message stops within the subnet at the gateway
            - however, broadcast messages can pass through switches -> extend the domain
        - learns the MAC addresses that it sees -> later when a message comes with a known MAC
          destination address, it looks into the content addressable memory (CAM) table and
          finds which ethernet port it is connected to
            - learns this only by looking at traffic
            - it receives a frame on port 5 that it has no destination for in the table
            - on one hand it makes an entry in the table that the source MAC address is
              connected to port 5
            - a copy of this message is sent out on every port
            - the network interface card that has this destination MAC address will likely
              reply through the same switch heading to the source of the original packet
            - reply comes on port 6
            - the switch sees this traffic and adds the entry to the table
            - now it knows that the that MAC address is connected to port 6
            => only learns MAC addresses by looking at the source (not the destination)
            => called Layer 2 forwarding
    - layer 3 devices (routers):
        - layer 3 (network): routes traffic between networks using IP addresses
        - interconnect multiple networks
        - limit broadcast domains, a layer 3 device is the network boundary
    - firewalls:
        - filter traffic based on predefined rules (Access Control Lists, ACLs)
            - Access Control List: a list of allowed devices, restricted IPs, restricted URLs,
              excluded devices, closed ports, ...
        - modern firewalls include deep packet inspection to analyze application-level traffic
        - not really a separate device, most routers have firewalls built into them, but it is
          rather a separate functionality
        - decides whether to allow a certain type of traffic to pass or not
        - filters based on layer 3 (IP address) and layer 4 (ports)
        - more modern firewalls have application layer visibility -> analyze the content of
          the packets, not just the addresses
    - load balancers:
        - distribute traffic among servers to prevent overloading
        - ensure redundancy and session persistence
        - also called a reverse proxy
            - forward proxy: a client needs to go outside the network
            - reverse proxy: clients from the internet trying to reach a resource inside your
              network -> it is a proxy because everybody needs to go through it

- content addressable memory (CAM) table
    - CAM table is empty by default
    - this table is a type of memory where you provide the content to retrieve a memory
      location, you provide the MAC address to get the memory address that corresponds to the
      correct port (much faster to search than e.g. linear search)
    - TCAM (ternary content addressable memory) is found in L3 switches (routers)

- switch (layer 2)

                                    |                       +---+
                                    +-----------------------| D |
                                                            +---+
    - A sends packet to C
        - src=A
        - dst=C
    - the switch sees this packet, the CAM table is still empty -> the switch sends a copy of
      this message out on every port (except port 1, the receiving port)
        - this is also called flooding
    - at the same time, the switch now knows that host A is located on port 1
    - the hosts that are not meant to receive this frame will simply discard the message
    - host C receives the frame and (likely) responds
        - src=C
        - dst=A
    - switch now knows that host C is located on port 3
    - and it already finds an entry in the CAM table for host A, so it forwards the message
      to port 1 (no more flooding)

- routers (layer 3)
    - we usually don't store each and every possible destination, but we summarize these
      destinations into larger networks into a so-called default route
    - you don't need to know the location of every host on the internet, you just need to know
      that whatever is not in your local network is out there -> forward it to the default
      gateway that leads outside of the network
    - route types:
        - connected routes: each interface of a router corresponds to a different network
        - static routes: can be manually entered by the admin
        - dynamic routes: learned by a routing protocol
            - routers learn this information from each other
            - scalable but more vulnerable than static routing

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    - how does host A know the MAC address of host C?
        - it does not... it needs to find out
        - host A sends out an ARP packet -> "who has IP address 192.168.0.1?"
            - you need to know the IP address
            - you might be connecting to a website -> resolvable URL
            - you might want to talk to a resolvable hostname in your local network
            - broadcast message
        - everybody in the network receives the ARP request
        - the host with that IP address replies with its MAC address
            - this is a unicast reply
    - there is no security built into ARP
    - we don't know that whoever is replying us actually has that IP address
    - MAC address is used within the local network, between direct links
        - if you want to send a message to another host in another network, your packet
          contains your computer's MAC as the source MAC, and your router's MAC as the
          destination MAC
        - your router removes the Ethernet frame and adds a new one where the source MAC is
          its own MAC and the destination MAC is the MAC of the next hop
        - at the end of the line, the local router of the other host sends the final packet
          with its MAC as the source and the host's MAC as the destination

- IPv4 vs. IPv6
    - IPv4: Limited address space (32-bit)
    - IPv6: Expanded address space (128-bit) with improved security and efficiency
    - both are currently in use
    - IPv4 header:
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        - Time to Live (TTL) = hop count, decremented by 1 on every hop (usually 64 or 128)
            -> prevents infinitely looping messages
        - protocol: upper layer protocol that follows it (TCP or UDP)
    IPv6 header is ironically more simple

- routing protocols
    - routing information can come from directly connected networks or from static routes
    - routers communicate destinations and how to reach these destination
    - protocols:
        - RIP (routing information protocol) : most used
        - OSPF (open shortest path first) : widely used in company networks
        - BGP (border gateway protocol) : large networks, used by ISP (internet service prov.)
        - IS-IS
        - EIGRP

- Network Segmentation
    - network segment: a region inside of a network where hosts can freely communicate with
                       each other, usually through a layer 2 addressing method
        -> through a switch or an access point
        -> also called subnets or broadcast domains
    - implement it using routers or layer 3 switches that are the subnet boundaries
    - VLAN is a layer 3 switch, it is a way of segmenting networks without relying on a router
        - virtual LAN
        - we can configure a managed switch to have each port in a specific VLAN
            - a managed switch is a switch with more capabilities and features
        - only ports that belong to the same VLAN can freely communicate with each other
        - every other host needs to go through a layer 3 device (router or L3 switch)
        - the IP addressing scheme is also adjusted, so VLAN is an actual subnet

- Topology
    - topology: the way a certain network is designed, how the subnets are organized
    - building block of a topology: zone
        - the members of a zone get the same security treatment
        - the same security policy applies to all members of a zone
        - e.g. internal network can be one zone, everyone inside the network get the same
          security treatment
    - security zones
        - intranet: internal network
        - extranet: network that are made up by remote connections that you trust
            - VPN, other offices, suppliers, ...
        - internet: filter traffic, don't trust anything
        - you can define any zone, e.g. wireless zone, or based on the departments
    - security policy must address the traffic flowing between zones

- demilitarized zone (DMZ)
    - there are certain situation where certain hosts need to be exposed to the internet
        - hosting VPN endpoint, web server, email server, ...
    - these exposed hosts are placed in a special zone called DMZ
    - strict security policies
        - to prevent attackers from gaining access to the network through a compromised host
    - bastion host
        - a dedicated server specifically designed to withstand cyberattacks and provide
          secure access to a private network from an untrusted one
        - positioned strategically at the network perimeter, typically outside a firewall or
          in a demilitarized zone
        - accept coming connections from the internet, authenticates the users, authorizes
          them and provides access to the rest of the network
    - possible topologies
        - screened subnet
            - between LAN and internet, you have two firewalls (FW)
            - between the two firewalls, there is the DMZ
            - the entire subnet between the two firewalls (the DMZ) is a screened subnet
            - can be implemented on one machine with two different firewall contexts

        - three-legged firewall
            - probably the most common
            - separate interface on the firewall that holds the DMZ services

        - screened host
            - cheapest
            - router (R) connects to the internet
            - screened host (SH) is behind the router
            - on the router we probably have some port forwarding rules that allow specific
              connections to reach this screened host
            - used in small networks, where only an email or web server needs to be exposed
            - not a true DMZ, usually implemented if the router has no DMZ functionality

- network security design
    - IPv6 policies
        - policies that apply to IPv4 should apply to IPv6 as well
        - services, applications, devices, etc, usually come with IPv6 enabled but not
          configured -> don't forget about it
        - default configurations are usually very permissive
    - east-west traffic and north-south traffic
        - north-south traffic: network traffic that enters or exits an organization's internal
          network
        - east-west traffic: the flow of data packets between servers within a data center
        - east-west traffic stays inside of the data center, you loose track of what is going
          on inside, which virtual machines are communication with which other virtual
          machines, which data bases, storage appliances
        - if one component becomes compromised, you might not be able to see the extent that
          compromise is going to affect the entire network, because you might only look at
          north-south traffic
        => don't forget about east-west traffic
    - zero trust
