Security Network Monitoring & SIEMs
-----------------------------------

- intrusion detection
    - system monitoring network traffic and application events (e.g. OS logs)
    - NIDS (Network-based Intrusion Detection System)
        - operates on a network-level
        - monitors and logs application traffic to detect malicious behavior
        - this functionality is usually built into e.g. larger firewall devices
        - examples software: Snort, Suricata, Zeek/Bro
        - rely on a database of signatures
            - how the traffic pattern should look like if it is a specific attack
            - sequence of packets, outlying type of packet, suspicious payload, ...
        - more advanced systems can correlate the network information with log information
            - suspicious traffic -> look at what the application does (logs)
        - just detection, cannot block malicious traffic even if identified, not prevention
            - raise some alerts, generate logs, ...
            - attacker is unable to detect this device, because it is not in the path
            - works with a copy of the traffic
    - monitoring traffic
        - how to make a copy of the traffic?
        - port mirroring or switch port analyzer (SPAN)
            - a functionality on L2 or L3 switches
            - switch can be configured that whatever traffic you see on port X, make a copy
              and forward it out of port Y -> goes to the monitoring device
            - you might not see 100% of the traffic, e.g. if the switch is overloaded or
              frames containing errors are dropped
        - TAP (Test Access Port)
            - L1 device
            - like a 'T' connector on the physical layer
            - simply duplicates the electrical signals it sees on the wire and makes a copy
            - copies frames with errors as well
            - signal repeater
        - inline transparent device
            - IDS device is in the traffic's path, but is transparent -> bridging
            - can actually block the traffic -> intrusion prevention
    - HIDS (Host-Based Intrusion Detection)
        - software package that can be installed on a host
        - kernel, memory, unencrypted content visibility
        - sees the processes, privileges, ...
        - file monitoring for integrity (FIM - File Integrity Monitoring)
            - especially for the operating system files

- intrusion prevention
    - NIPS (Network-based Intrusion Prevention System)
        - active response when detecting intrusion
            - reset: send a TCP reset packet -> break connection
            - drop: can also block traffic
            - police: limit the bandwidth if DoS is detected
            - e.g. based on ACLs
        - inline: AV, reputation & URL filtering
            - needs a lot of processing power if e.g. decryption is needed
    - IDS/IPS detection methods
        - detection is the same for both, the action is what differs
        - signatures: known patterns in a database
            - up-to-date database is needed
            - usually better maintained by commercial providers -> costs money
            - open-source is also good, but not always up-to-date
            - new attacks are not detected either way
        - behavioral: define a baseline, then look for anomalies
            - not looking at bytes and headers
            - looks at the overall behavior of an application or protocol
            - is it doing what it should be, is it generating the expected amount of traffic?
            - what do we compare the behavior to?
                -> this is the baseline
                - leave a system in the network for some weeks, see how does a normal traffic
                  and behavior look like? How does the traffic look like when people are
                  accessing internal applications or over the internet? How do midnight
                  backups look like?
                - machine learning can benefit this area
        - false positives & false negatives
            - there are always errors -> "IPS without eyes is useless"
            - false positives are not a security risk

- devices implementing IPS functions
    - NGFW (Next-Generation Firewalls)
        - application-level firewalls + built-in IPS
        - always-present term, no-one knows where it starts/started, where it will end
        - just an L7 firewall -> looks at the application-level payload
    - UTM (Unified Thread Management devices)
        - all-in-one security device: firewall, IPS, IDS, URL filtering, anti-malware,
          anti-spam, DLP, ...
        - lot of functionalities -> worse performance, higher latency
    - WAF (Web Application Firewall)
        - rulesets that detect web-based attacks
        - looking for attacks that are trying to exploit some input validation flaw
        - mostly signature-based
        - can be a separate network appliance
        - can be part of the webserver -> plugin-based for Apache, nginx, IIS

- monitoring the network
    - making a copy of every traffic might not be feasible
    - you can create a summary of the traffic and analyze this summary
        - called netflow
        - summary contains the sources, number of bytes, flags, ...
        - you loose application layer visibility, you only have a summary
        - you gain performance
    - sometimes looking at the traffic is not feasible either -> network performance monitors
        - monitors switches, routers, servers, ...
        - CPU load, data-rate, routing table, ARP table, DHCP state, ...
        - protocols to perform this monitoring: SNMP, WMI, ...
        - can collect logs from the monitored devices as well

- SIEMs
    - Security Information & Event Management
    - does correlation -> looks for patterns, e.g. correlates network traffic with logs
    - can collect logs from every device: laptops, mobile devices, routers, ...
    - powerful and expensive tool
        - log and alert storage
        - log analysis, learning, baselining, pattern-matching and deviations
        - log correlation
        - high-level overview of security posture
    - simple reports can be generated using standard database queries
    - advanced machine-learning-built reports
    - UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analysis)
        - track and machine-learn how users behave, identify abnormal behavior
    - user sentiment analysis -> interpreting events or intention from natural language
        - emotion AI
        - not analyzing emails and such, those would go against privacy regulations
        - based on blog posts, social media posts, other publicly available data
        - sound good on paper, the technology is not fully there yet
    - SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)
        - usually built into SIEM solutions, but could be a standalone solution as well
        - tries to address the problem of too much information
            - too many incidents, too many events
            - the IT department should not be overwhelmed
        - uses machine-learning techniques
        - analyses some events, determines if an attack is going on, takes action

- SIEM data sources
    - agents on hosts/servers
        - designed to be installed on windows or linux
        - running as background processes
        - periodically scan the system and send reports to the SIEM
        - SIEM has different plugins to understand the log format of different vendors
    - built-in listeners or collectors (standard syslog, SNMP traps, Netflow variants)
        - they are expected to send a copy of their syslog
        - they should be configured to do so, SIEM is not getting it, they are sending it
        - netflow: a summary of the traffic over a period of time
    - sensors for network traffic
        - SIEM can capture raw packet data if a device sends the SIEM a copy
        - also, external devices can monitor raw traffic and send summary to SIEM
    => SIEM collects these and correlates them

- SIEM normalization and aggregation
    - log normalization: feature built into most SIEM solutions
        - log is collected from 100s of vendors, 1000s of appliances, different OSs, different
          versions, different log formats, JSON, XML, UTF-8, \n, \r\n, ...
        - these need to be collected in a centralized database so that it can be accessed
        => normalization
        - vendor plugins are used for normalizing the vendor-specific log files
    - timestamp normalization is important as well
        - local vs UTC, timezones, daylight saving time, 12h, 24h, ...
        - otherwise order of events is not consistent

- SIEM analysis and detection
    - rule-matching
        - if-then-else approach
        - fast
        - useless against unknown threats, because they are not yet in the database
    - heuristic rule-matching
        - a more "permissive" if-then-else
        - not an exact matching, but close to it
        - requires you to constantly fine-tune your rule set
    - behavioral analysis
        - build baseline, define how "normal" operation looks like
        - statistical model, requires human intervention for fine-tuning
        - might create a lot of false-positives
            - irregular backup, does happen rarely, a human needs to okay it for SIEM
    - anomaly analysis
        - compare observed behavior with known standard behavior
        - e.g. deviation from the RFC
    - trends analysis
        - look for historical patterns
        - e.g. backup produces around 5GB traffic, then sudden 10GB traffic is suspicious
        - e.g. 2GB last week, 4GB this week -> 6GB is not suspicious next week
        - based on predictions, but they must be trusted

- SIEM rules
    - start from a predefined set of rules
    - customization is required to mach each environment
    - rule: statement that matches conditions by
        - numerical value
        - string comparison
        - set membership
        - unified AND/OR operations
    - rules are sometimes similar to database (SQL) queries
        select <field> where <condition> sort by <field> ...

- not everyone has money for a SIEM solution
    -> manual commands are sometimes enough to look at logs
    - cat, head, tail, grep
