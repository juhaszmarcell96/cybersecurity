Switching and Routing Security
------------------------------

- back in the days, most protocols were not designed with security in mind
- not all security functions require dedicated devices
    - both switches and routers can implement low-level but effective security functions
    - not enabled by default

- layer 2 security features
    1. eavesdropping and intercepting traffic
        - layer 2 is inherently susceptible to eavesdropping because:
            - devices like switches forward frames based on MAC addresses, trusting the source
              and destination data without verification
            - protocols like ARP lack security mechanisms
        - man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
            - definition: attacker positions themselves between source and destination,
              intercepting or modifying traffic
                - on-path attack
            - example scenarios:
                - replying to a DNS request with a fake website's IP address
                - intercepting login credentials on an unencrypted network
                - modifying financial data during transmission
            - prevention:
                - encryption (e.g., HTTPPS, VPN)
                - securing ARP to prevent spoofing (discussed below)
    2. MAC address spoofing
        - most common MITM attack on layer 2 (= within a single subnet)
        - definition: attacker fakes their MAC address to impersonate another device
        - also called MAC cloning when it is about stealing some else's MAC address
        - how it works:
            - attacker sends spoofed frames, pretending to be the legitimate device
            - switch updates its CAM (content addressable memory) table to associate the
              attacker's port with the legitimate device's MAC
        - impact:
            - traffic meant for the legitimate device is redirected to the attacker
        - tools: MAC spoofing tools are widely available, making this attack accessible even
          to non-experts
        - mitigation strategies
            - port security (sticky MAC):
                - restricts the number of MAC addresses on a port
                - dynamically learns and locks the first MAC address seen on each port
                - example: a port can be configured to allow only one or two MAC addresses,
                  sufficient for a desktop and a voip phone
            - MAC filtering:
                - manually specify allowed MAC addresses for each port
                - limitation: labor-intensive and ineffective against spoofing
    3. ARP spoofing (ARP poisoning)
        - ARP is inherently insecure
        - definition: exploits ARP's lack of authentication to send fake ARP replies
            - inject false ARP information in network hosts' ARP tables
            - a host can learn from an ARP reply even if it was not the one who sent the
              request to begin with (ARP is stateless)
        - mechanism:
            - attacker sends unsolicited ARP replies with incorrect MAC-IP mappings
            - devices update their ARP tables with false information, redirecting traffic to
              the attacker
        - example:
            - attacker impersonates the default gateway, capturing all outbound internet
              traffic
            - most commonly attackers present themselves as the default gateway, every packet
              meant for the internet goes through it and is rerouted to the actual gateway so
              that it can inspect the whole communication
        - tools: common tools include Ettercap, Dsniff, and ARPspoof, metasploit
        - mitigation strategies
            - DHCP snooping and dynamic ARP inspection (DAI):
                - DHCP snooping: monitors DHCP traffic to map MAC-IP-port bindings
                - DAI: inspects ARP packets and compares them against the DHCP snooping
                  database, rejecting spoofed packets
            - network segmentation:
                - use VLANs to isolate critical devices and minimize ARP spoofing risk
    4. CAM table overflow
        - switches use the CAM table to forward traffic to the right port
        - overwhelms a switch's memory with fake MAC addresses, forcing it to broadcast all
          frames
        - when the CAM table is full, but the requested MAC address is not in the table, the
          switch starts to flood information through every port again, because it cannot learn
          any more new information -> transforms any unicast to broadcast
            - you as an attacker fill the switch's CAM table with bogus information, then you
              also receive every message, since they are turned into broadcast messages
        - impact:
            - converts unicast traffic into broadcast traffic
            - allows attackers to intercept all traffic within the VLAN
        - mitigation:
            - enable port security to limit the number of MAC addresses a port can learn
            - use managed switches with adequate memory
    5. spanning tree protocol (STP) attacks
        - loop: layer 2 switches are connected in a cycle
            - physical loops are good, it is fault-tolerant, there are alternate paths
        - logical loops are not so good, there is no loop prevention mechanism in the
            Ethernet header, no time-to-live or anything else
            - you need to rely on other protocols to manage loops
            - STP (spanning tree protocol) runs between L2 switches, whenever a physical
                loop is detected, switches automatically shut down certain interfaces to
                prevent a logical loop
        - STP packets are called bridge protocol data units (BPDUs)
            - small packets based on which they decide what ports to shut down
            - STP is old, no security
            - attacker can present themselves as a switch and they can fool the other switches
            - attackers could change the actual topology of the active switches
                - the attacker poses as a switch and adjusts the topology so that traffic
                  flows through their machine (root switch)
        - mitigation:
            - enable BPDU guard on ports not connected to other switches
                - some ports are configured to reject BPDU packets
                - ports that are connected to workstations and not to other switches should
                  not receive any STP traffic
    6. broadcast storms
        - a switch forwards broadcast messages to all other ports by default
        - an attacker could attack the STP infrastructure and intentionally create a loop
          inside the network -> broadcast messages are looping indefinitely
            -> high CPU utilization, link saturation -> denial of service attack
        - excessive broadcast traffic overwhelms the network, often due to loops or intentional flooding
        - mitigation:
            - enable broadcast storm control: monitors and caps broadcast traffic thresholds
                - if it sees looping packets, it shuts down the port or blocks the MAC address

- filtering traffic at layer 2?
    - can only filter based on MAC addresses
    - MAC access list = list of MAC addresses that are allowed to communicate through a given
      port
    - MAC address filtering = global for the switch, defines the allowed devices on the
      network, only the allowed devices can send packets through that switch
    - can also define a block list, who are explicitly not allowed on the network
        - not practical, MAC address spoofing is easy
    - MAC filtering requires frequent maintenance
    - port security: automatically manages the allowed MAC addresses onto the switch
        - switch looks at the first MAC address on a port after startup
        - it stores that first MAC address
        - no other MAC address is allowed on that port
        - hopefully the attacker is not already in the network
        - this is not stored in the CAM table, but in permanent memory
        - you can increase this limit, allowing two or three MAC addresses for a port
        - also called a "sticky" MAC address implementation
        - used against MAC address spoofing
        - is not effective against ARP spoofing
    - ARP spoofing can be mitigated using DHCP snooping (DAI = Dynamic ARP Inspection)
        - DHCP traffic can be used to see who is connected to which port
        - switch can be configured to look at this traffic
            - the switch builds a database about who is connected to which port
        - when DAI is enabled, the switch also looks at ARP packets
            - can identify ARP spoofing
            - the attacker announces themselves with another MAC address than it was
              originally detected with on that port
            - switch can deny traffic
    => this functionality is built into many switches today, but is not configured

- network access control (NAC) / network access protection (NAP) / 802.1X
    - securing switchport access
    - generic authentication
    - a kind of protocol that can be implemented at a switchport level
    - we can configure a switchport to make it mandatory for whoever connects to that
      switchport to present some sort of authentication information before being allowed to
      communicate through the port (works the same also for wireless switching)
    - EAP over LAN (extensible authentication protocol)
        - can carry authentication information between switch and device
        - username, password, smart card, one-time password, certificate, ...
    - the switches that support EAP over LAN need to access an external database
        - AAA server (RADIUS, LDAP, active directory)
        - the switches talk to the AAA server and dynamically reconfigure the ports based on
          the answer
    - posture assessment
        - not just looking at credentials, but also at the actual device
            - Windows, Linux, Mac, ...
            - updates?
            - antivirus?
            - ...
        => only allow legitimate and safe devices
        - lot of admin effort, but after it is put into place, it is fully automatic
        - to find out all of this information, the switch communicates with a specific
          software installed on your host, also a proof that you are part of the network

- securing routing information (L3)
    - routers are just computers running some software or firmware
    - they have bugs and potential exploits
    - other risks:
        - unauthorized information injection
            - by default routing protocols do not enforce authentication requirements
            - anyone can send routing information
            - the protocols have authentication mechanisms that require the sender to sign
              the information that they are sending
            - based on password or secret key
        - routing update sniffing
            - intercepting routing updates
            - routing information is transferred from one router to the other
                - usually in clear text
                - attackers can intercept it, they can find out a lot about the topology and
                  the devices
        - source routing
            - routing usually happens by looking at the destination IP address
            - certain options in the IP header can enable source routing
                - it can tell the router over which hops the packet is supposed to be sent
                - packet comes preconfigured with the route
                - not enabled by default
                - if enabled, attackers can redirect messages through them
                - not that important since it is disabled in routers by default nowadays
